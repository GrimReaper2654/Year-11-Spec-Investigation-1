How to Use:
The text field called N is the number of terms (max 15) <br>
The sequence is the top row of numbers (set auto sequence to 0 to input your own numbers)<br>
The premutator is the second row of numbers<br>
Set Auto sequence to 1 to automatically fill the sequence with 1,2,3,...<br><br>

The sequence can ONLY be numbers<br><br>

PS: If the code breaks, create an issue and I will fix it.
